                    Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it to make. a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries. but also the
                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. There are many variations of
                    passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
                    injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to
                    use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
                    middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
                    necessary</p>

                    Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
                    Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
                    structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore
                    always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc</p>
                  <p class="info-text">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
                    in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                    McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                    obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                    Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                    section 1.10.32</p>
